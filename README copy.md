### Client Repo - https://github.com/harrdev/ClientVinyasa  

**Created by: Hannah Legros and Jason Harr**  

## App Objectives
* With Vinyasa builder you can create your custom Yoga routine.
* Upon registration/login, a user can select which difficulty poses they would like to learn about and add to their routine.
* Once poses are selected to be added to the create routine pane of the page, drag and drop is enabled to arrange the routine as the user would prefer.
* A "detail" page is available to learn benefits of the pose.
* Submitted/saved routines are stored in the user's profile page.
* In the profile page, a user can delete or start their routine.
* In the Start Routine page, a slideshow displays the images of that pose to demonstrate proper form.

## Project Prerequisites
1. Install packages: npm i
2. Seed database
    * In server-vinyasa project: node seeds/seeds.js
3. Tech Stack

## Approach 
The approach to this project was to build the server with Node.js and Express, and to build the client in React.  Database models created and interfaced with Mongoose.  
## Unsolved Problems / Version 2
1. Implement drag out of pane feature for removing a pose from the created routine page
2. Implement a timer for slideshow to change on an interval based on how long a routine is set for
3. Implement a music option to play during Start Routine

## Version 3
1. Implement Tensorflow to detect user's pose form and send notice if form is not correct
